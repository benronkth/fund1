# Launch Interceptor Program

This repository includes code that includes the ``` DECIDE() ``` function used in a hypothetical anti-ballistic missile system. The ``` DECIDE() ``` function generates a boolean signal which determines whether an interceptor should be launched based upon input radar tracking information. This radar tracking information has to be available at the instant the function is called. This project is made for Software Engineering Fundamentals course (DD2480) in KTH.
